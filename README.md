# Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of brain tumors from MRI scans using advanced deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors. The project uses transfer learning with the pre-trained **Xception model** and a custom-built **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify MRI images into four categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

An interactive **Streamlit** web app has been developed to allow users to upload MRI scans and receive predictions along with visual explanations.

## Features

### Deep Learning Models
- **Xception Model**: 
  - Pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned for brain tumor classification.
  - Uses deep convolutional layers for feature extraction and classification.
  - Achieves high generalization and accuracy.

- **Custom CNN Model**:
  - Built from scratch using **Keras**.
  - Includes convolutional layers, max pooling, and dense layers.
  - Optimized for MRI image classification, providing robust performance on unseen data.
  - Achieved **98% accuracy** on test data.

### Interactive Web App
- Developed using **Streamlit** to enable real-time MRI scan analysis.
- Users can upload MRI images and get predictions from both models.
- Provides detailed insights and saliency map visualizations for predictions.

### Saliency Map Generation
- Integrated **Gemini 1.5 Flash** for generating visual explanations of predictions.
